# twitter_chessbot

The goal of this project is to follow up my tic tac toe chessbot I made about two years ago. I will just be leveraging a bunch of already developed technology but having it interact and providing an interface via twitter.

## Technology
- python 3.7 (hopefully not too bleeding edge)
- heroku
- Tweepy
- sunfish
- twitter

## Usage
- Twitter user can play a game against the chessbot
- Twitter users can play against each other
